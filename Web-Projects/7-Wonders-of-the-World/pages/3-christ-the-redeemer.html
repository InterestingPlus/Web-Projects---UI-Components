        <h1>About Christ the Redeemer</h1>
        <p>
          Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian
          Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ
          in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul
          Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in
          collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor
          Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931,
          the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft)
          pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of
          reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ The Redeemer
          differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was
          a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other.
          Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it
          later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is
          located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in
          the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. This
          statue is the largest Art Deco style sculpture in the world.[6] A
          symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a
          cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of
          the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion,
          Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of Rio, consecrated a
          chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint—Our Lady of the
          Apparition—under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and
          weddings there.[5] Lightning struck the statue during a violent
          thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers,
          head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a
          restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and
          repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again on
          January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.
        </p>

        <h2>Restoration</h2>
        <p>
          More work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and
          early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were
          installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue.
          The four-month restoration in 2010[25] focused on the statue itself.
          The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic
          covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other
          microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located
          in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting
          fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian
          monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid-1850s to honor Princess Isabel,
          regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project
          was not approved.[1] In 1889, the country became a republic, and owing
          to the separation of church and state the proposed statue was
          dismissed.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture and design</h2>
        <p>
          Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February
          10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The
          Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to
          replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning
          rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again on January 17, 2014,
          dislodging a finger on the right hand. In 2010, a massive restoration
          of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and
          soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure,
          and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during
          renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called
          the act "a crime against the nation". The culprits later apologized
          and presented themselves to the police.
