        <h1>About The Greate Wall of China</h1>
        <p>
          The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built
          across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and
          Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
          Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
          century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang
          (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall
          remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
          multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the
          wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included
          border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods
          transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
          and the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the
          defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the
          construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations,
          signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the
          fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
          corridor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses.
          Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in
          the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao
          River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the
          edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in
          total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
          generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats
          in history.[8]
        </p>

        <h2>Names</h2>
        <p>
          In Chinese histories, the term "Long Wall(s)" (t 長城, s 长城,
          Chángchéng) appears in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian,
          where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and
          north of the Warring States and to the more unified construction of
          the First Emperor.[9] The Chinese character 城, meaning city or
          fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the "earth" radical 土 and
          phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as
          *deŋ.[10] It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded
          traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls
          around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often
          the Chinese word for "city".
        </p>
        <h2>Early walls</h2>
        <p>
          The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building
          by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th
          centuries BC.[22] During this time and the subsequent Warring States
          period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and
          Zhongshan[23][24] all constructed extensive fortifications to defend
          their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as
          swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by
          stamping earth and gravel between board frames.
        </p>
        <h2>Ming era</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th
          century,[30] and following the Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the
          Battle of Tumu. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over
          the Mongol tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn
          conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new
          strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along
          the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control
          established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's
          southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.
