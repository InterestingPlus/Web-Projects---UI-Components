        <h1>About The Taj-Mahal</h1>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
          the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
          1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his
          beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
          himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which
          includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
          bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but
          work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.
          The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
          Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of
          Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time to thousands of
          mourners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
          entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32
          million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$498
          million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under
          the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the
          emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been
          employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
          for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the
          universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
          regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a
          symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts around 5
          million visitors a year, and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the
          New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.
        </p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the
          Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara, meaning the illumined or illustrious
          tomb. The current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and
          believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj
          mahall meaning "crown" "palace". The name "Taj" came from the
          corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz".
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in
          the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year,
          while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction
          started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the
          surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The
          imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of
          Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for
          the Taj Mahal. According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin
          Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show
          the same level of affection to others as he had shown her while she
          was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along
          with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years.
          Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of
          Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. This
          place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan
          and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture and design</h2>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of
          Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration
          came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e
          Amir, Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
          hasht-behesht plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb, and Shah
          Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were
          primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of
          white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his
          patronage reached new levels of refinement.
