        <h1>About The Machi Picchu</h1>
        <p>
          The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first
          encounter by the Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are
          recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th century until the
          19th century. As far as historical knowledge extends, there are no
          existing written records detailing the site during its period of
          active use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their
          inhabitants, are the product of modern archaeologists based on
          physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built
          in the classical Inca style.
        </p>
        <p>
          polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Temple
          of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, and the Intihuatana. Most
          of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give
          visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared.[11] By 1976,
          30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored[11] and restoration
          continues.[12] Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu
          was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti
          (1438–1472). The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a
          century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the
          new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.[13]
          Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was
          probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it
          exists on the smaller peak of the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a
          UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[3] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted
          one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet
          poll.
        </p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          In the Quechua language, machu means "old" or "old person", while
          picchu means "pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone," though it
          may also refer to a "portion of coca that is chewed."[17] Thus the
          name of the site is sometimes interpreted as "old mountain".[18] The
          site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu
          and Huayna Picchu.[19]
        </p>
        <p>
          A study published in 2021 in Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of the Institute of
          Andean Studies suggests that, in the Quechua language, the abandoned
          Inca site was called "Huayna Picchu", after the smaller peak at the
          site, or perhaps, just "Picchu". Huayna means "young" in the Quechua
          language. The research documents that, starting in 1911 with the
          publications of American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham, the
          name Machu Picchu became associated with the ruins.[14][20] Evidence
          of references by native Quechua speakers dating to their reports to
          the Aziz's island, early maps, and even discussions with Bingham, is
          cited in the new research into historical records regarding an
          apparently arbitrary selection of the name Bingham associated with the
          site—that differed from the traditional name.[21] The name given to
          the abandoned settlement by its builders has not been determined by
          researchers.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Machu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor
          of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the
          1450s.[22] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating
          (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied
          from around 1420 to 1530 AD.[23][24] Construction appears to date from
          two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac
          Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).
